                <p>All the stamped designs on the garments were hand cut and pressed by me using leftover material from <a href="https://diantres.co/" target="_blank">Diantres</a>, a screenprinting and design studio from Bogota, Colombia. I'm grateful for your generosity and love.</p> <p> The text "They Dream" was written by Nicolás Castro. </p> <p>All the drawings are part of an ongoing practice to communicate beyond meaning and sense.</p> 
                <p>All of the garments are single pieces and the ones marked with a ↺ were found in second-hand shops.</p>
