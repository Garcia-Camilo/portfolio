                <p>All the stamped designs on the garments were hand cut and pressed by me using leftover material from <a href="https://diantres.co/" target="_blank">Diantres</a>, a screenprinting and design studio from Bogota, Colombia. I'm grateful for your generosity and love.</p> <p> The text "They Dream" was written by Nicolás Castro. </p> <p>All the drawings are part of an ongoing practice to communicate beyond meaning and sense.</p> 
                <p>All of the garments are single pieces and the ones marked with a ↺ were found in second-hand shops.</p>

        <p class="thunderbolts_text right down center"> They Dream</p>
        <p id="start" class="left up">In a dream, I found myself inside a cave.</p>
        <p class="right down">Illuminated by a faint summer light, I carved a poem on clear stones with chisel and hammer. I recited what I had carved, and once I had done this, I silently reviewed in my mind what I would carve and had not yet carved.</p> 
        <p class="left up">I contemplated, for instance, an idea: a dream...carving light onto a dark cloud...</p>
        <p class="right down">In a dream, I find myself within the evening. Illuminated by the light of the night, I carve with light a poem of confusing, cumbersome, incomprehensible words onto a dark cloud.</p> 
        <p class="thunderbolts_text up">Thunderbolts hang on the horizon.</p> 
        <p class="right down">It's my voice, it's my voice! I say to myself excitedly. It's my voice that declaims the signs woven on the divine carpet, the firmament.</p>
        <p class="left up">I rest upon the rug.</p>
        <p class="right down center">I sleep.</p> 
        <p class="left up">I will dream, I imagine, that I am inside the barrel of a gun. I will be a bullet. A bullet traveling at extraordinary and uncommon speed.</p>
        <p class="right down">Perhaps, you could say, approaching the speed of light. I will grasp time with my hands. Large hands that will be held by short and emaciated arms.</p> 
        <p class="left up">Arms that will sprout from the body of a bullet. From a bullet that will decide, once fired, to grasp time and, in its elongation, in that suspended time, as thin as a wheat tortilla, as malleable as the aluminum of a car in a crash, to trace words that have no beginning or end, indecipherable, dormant. </p>
        <p class="right down">Words that float.</p>
        <p class="left up">Words that are the flight path of mosquitoes in the air.</p> 
        <p class="right down">Words that will make the people of the future dream about their past.</p>
        <p class="left up">Words that think they lie inside a cave.</p> 
        <p class="right down">One, illuminated by a faint summer light. One in which, on its rocks, dark clouds, are being carved into poems.</p>
        <p class="left up">Words that carve words. Light that sculpts light. Words that sleep in wakefulness. They snore. They dream.</p>
